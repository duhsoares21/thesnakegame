# Snake Game - x64 Assembly

A classic Snake game written entirely in **x64 Assembly (MASM)** using the native Windows API.

This project is a learning and experimentation project focused on building a complete small game from the ground up without using a game engine, framework, or runtime library.

The goal is to explore low-level Windows development, graphics rendering, input handling, memory management, and game architecture using Assembly language.

## Technical Details

### Language

- **x64 Assembly (MASM)**

### Platform

- Windows x64

### APIs Used

- Win32 API
- GDI
- XInput
- Kernel32
- User32

### Rendering

The renderer uses:

- GDI device contexts
- Off-screen rendering buffer
- BitBlt-based double buffering

The rendering pipeline:

```
Game State
|
v
Render Commands
|
v
Memory Back Buffer
|
v
BitBlt
|
v
Window
```

## Why Assembly?

This project was created to explore what is possible when building software at a very low level.

Modern game development usually relies on:

- Game engines
- High-level languages
- Frameworks
- Middleware

While those tools are extremely powerful, Assembly provides a unique perspective:

- Direct CPU control
- Understanding of memory layout
- Manual calling conventions
- Native API interaction
- Minimal executable size

The entire game logic, rendering system, input handling, and window management are implemented manually.

---

## Project Goals

This project is not intended to replace modern game engines.

Instead, it is an exploration of:

- How games worked before large engines existed
- How operating systems expose functionality
- How high-level features are built from low-level primitives
- Learning computer architecture through practical development
